# How To Run:
- Clone the app into your local repository using **git clone (link)**
- Once installed, open the glue folder in a terminal and run **npm install**. This will install all of the dependencies and packages needed to run our app.
- Once packages are installed, run **npm run dev** and click the link to our app.

Since our app uses MongoDB, you will need to reach out to one of the app contributors for key.js - the app will not function without it.

# Testing:
If you would like to run our test scripts, open a terminal and run **npm test**. This will run all of the tests in the __tests__ folder.

# Features:
